Quick software to visualise a maths problem.
This question can be found in the book Additional Maths 360, page 233, Q18

The software demonstrates how the equation of the path traced by any point P such that PA = 2PB, where 
A is (-a, 0) , B is (a, 0) is a circle.

Methodology:
1. Evaluate the radius and centre of circle mentioned above using pytha and general form of circle
2. Create variables based on the derived ans
3. Make use of the points formed on the circle as rotational references

Some shortcomings:
- Did not create an effect where the lines trace out a circle, just shows you a ellipse instead with the 2 lines moving along
